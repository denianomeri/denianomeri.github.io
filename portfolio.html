     <div class="myWeek1">
        <h1>Data Science for Economists.</h1>
        
        <h3>Week 1: Bilateral trade</h3>
        <p>The first chart tracks trade between the UK and France.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>

        <h3>Week 1: Ozone concentration</h3>
        <p>My second chart compares average daily ozone concentration for the UK and Bristol</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>

        <h3>Week 2: IMF lending</h3>
        <p>The first chart tracks credit outstanding to all members. The most risky year is 1984 because the credit outstanding, as a percentage of GDP, is the highest for 1984.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>

        <h3>Week 2: IMF exchange rates</h3>
        <p>The second chart tracks percentage change in rate against U.S. dollar from previous calculation.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"> </div>

        <h3>Week 3: Gilt Strip Yields</h3>
        <p>The week 3 chart tracks yields and matruity date. It's better to use a line chart than a bar chart as I have temporal data on x-axis so I changed mark type to line.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"> </div>

        <h3>Week 4: GDP Annual Growth Rate</h3>
        <p>The week 4 chart tracks annual GDP growth from 1960-2020. I chose this site as I am interested in annual GDP growth trends.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"> </div>

        <h3>Project prep: Unemployment rates</h3>
        <p>The theme for week 5 is UK unemployment</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart7"> </div>

        <h3>Week 8: Festival of Economics</h3>
        <p>In the Festival of Economics session on prices and wages, an argument was made that wages and GDP growth are positively correlated. Whilst this is what we expect theoretically, in practise there is a very weak negative correlation between the two variables in the UK between 1999-2021.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart8"> </div>

        <h3>Week 8: Festival of Economics</h3>
        <p>In the Festival of Economics session on prices and wages, an argument was made that inflation and GDP growth are positively correlated. In theoretical economics this is what we expect and we find a positive correlation between the two variables based on UK evidence between 1999-2021.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart9"> </div>

        <h3>Week 9: Bubble chart</h3>
        <p>The bubble chart shows the relationship between income (Nominal GDP per capita) and CO2 emissions per capita.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart10"> </div>

        <h3>Week 9: 2nd Bubble chart</h3>
        <p>The bubble chart shows the relationship between income (Nominal GDP per capita) and healthcare outcomes (life expectancy).</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart11"> </div>

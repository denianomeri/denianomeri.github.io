        <h1>Bargaining Strength of Employees in the UK</h1>

        <h3>Aims</h3>
        <p>Many economists believe wage growth is positively correlated with the job vacancy ratio and negatively correlated with unemployment rate. The extent of labour market tightness determines the bargaining strength of employees in wage negotiations with firms, and subsequently the negotiated wage. I want to investigate the extent to which this theory holds by establishing the relationship between the job vacancy ratio and real wage growth for the UK, before breaking down the analysis into different sectors.</p>

        <h3>Data Description</h3>
        <p>Inflation (Chart 3) and Unemployment (Chart 4) ONS data was dowloaded from their API links using loops in Google Colab. For other charts, ONS data was also downloaded from their APIs. However, instead of directly using the APIs the data values for each year in January were manually typed onto excel and saved in CSV format. Real wage growth data couldn't be found for sectors, hence nominal growth was used. The use of APIs is justified because charts 3&4 can update automatically. However, APIs weren't directly used in the other charts because I wanted to present annual trends given the project's purpose is to go as far back in time as available in the ONS database. The Covid-19 Pandemic is included because it demonstrates the strength of employee bargaining power during a period that saw record job vacancy ratios. All data was uploaded onto my GitHub account with the name "project" included in each relevant json file.</p>

        <h3>Data Analysis Challenges and Solutions</h3>
        <p>One challenge was compiling data from the APIs onto excel. Time was spent manually aligning different variables and correpsonding values for all charts except 3&4. One problem with Chart 2 was the data selector not being responsive. Therefore, the plan to have a selector to focus on a particular period was abandoned and instead, a tooltip was used that moves along the series as I hover. Issues relating to Vega coding and Google Colab loops were quickly resolved using the relevant Blackboard material.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion: Overall UK Trends</h3>
        <p>Real Wage = Nominal Wage - Inflaition Rate. Real wage growth plummeted from 3.8% to negative 4% between 2007-2009, with the Vacancy Ratio simultaneously decreasing by 29%. Post financial crisis, there's a positive relationship between both variables until Covid-19 commenced, with real wage growth improving by 2.3 percentage points and the vacancy ratio increasing from 1.7-2.7/100 employee jobs from 2010-2020. This suggests improvements to employee bargaining power. Inflation trends in the 2010s capture real wage changes by applying the given equation. Inflation dropped from 4.7%-0.1% between 2011Q3-2015Q1, indicating falling inflation contributed to real wage growth. However, in the latter part of the decade it rose to 3% by 2017Q4, suppressing real wage growth. What's interesting about Covid-19 is the vacancy ratio reaching a record 4.1, although real wage growth decreased by 3.4 percentage points in 2022. Given inflation reached a record 10% in 2022Q3, the real wage growth could be attributed to diminishing employee purchasing power. Post-financial crisis, the unemployment rate halved between 2010Q1-2020Q1 suggesting bargaining power improved because frictional unemployment is more likely to be lower. What's less clear is how real wage growth still increases between 2020-2021 despite unemployment increasing from 4%-5.2% between 2020Q1-2020Q4.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion: UK sectors</h3>
        <p>Nominal wage growth and vacancy ratio trends for construction adheres to classical economic theory. Here, there's a time gap between vacancy ratio chnages and wage growth. Between 2007-2008, the vacancy ratio fell by 62.5% and wage growth stagnated between 2011-2013. Wholesailing recorded wage growth fluctuations, even though vacancy ratios were less volatile pre-pandemic. Regarding Finance, the period 2004-2007 sees consistently high wage growth averaging 6.1%, whereas the period 2012-2015 sees growth stagnate at -0.6%. Whilst the vacancy ratio does increase from 3.1-3.7/100 in the former period, vacancy growth is unexpectedly higher in the latter period. Manufacturing and Services both record fluctuations in nominal wage growth, even though the vacancy ratio for both sectors remains relatively consistent, with the exception of January 2022.</p>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <p>Without increasing sector samples, it's difficult to analyse the strength of employee bargaining power for all sectors. Further, research only covers the UK, hence research for other economies are required for international comparisons. UK Data indicates increases in vacancy ratios (with certain exceptions) lead to wage growth increases, suggesting employees leverage greater wage bargaining power. Sectors do not always adhere to classical economic theory. Some sectors record time lags, whereas there's no clear observable relationship for others.</p>
